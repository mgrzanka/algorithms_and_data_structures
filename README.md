# Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains projects completed for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course at Warsaw University of Technology. Each project focuses on implementing and understanding fundamental algorithms and data structures critical to computer science.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
Implementations of various sorting algorithms, including:
- Bubble Sort,
- Insertion Sort,
- Merge Sort,
- Quick Sort,
- Selection Sort

### 2. Heaps
Implementation of d-ary heaps with functions to insert, pop and display the heap.

### 3. Binary Trees
Implementation of binary trees and operations, including:
- Binary Search Tree (BST) operations: insertion, deletion, and search
- AVL Trees and balancing techniques

### 4. Graph Algorithms
Projects focusing on graph representation and algorithms:
- Graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Minimum Spanning Trees: Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms
- Shortest Path algorithms: Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford
- Graph coloring and connected components

### 5. Turing Machines
Simulating basic Turing Machines to explore:
- Concepts of computation and decidability
- Design of Turing Machines for simple tasks
- Analysis of computational steps and complexity

## How to Run
Each project is organized in separate directories. Navigate to the directory of interest - the source code wil be in 'src' directory.

### Requirements
- A Python interpreter
- Basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures

## Contributions
This repository is intended for educational purposes, but contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the implementations or add new examples.
